# Portfolio Project 2 - Match Teams README
## 1. Purpose of the project

Match Teams is designed for groups playing non-competitive team sports for fun. It allows the user to enter participants' names and the application will then create two teams from the player list. Match results can be entered and this updates player points and the player rankings. Subsequent team selections are based on the latest player rankings with the aim of picking more evenly matched teams. As this is intended as a fun application, player points and rankings run in the background and remain hidden from the user.

Player points awarded are based purely on the score difference in a given match with all players on the winning side awarded the same points. This was considered the best approach in pursuit of a Minimum Viable Product and further refinement could be considered in the future. This is discussed in more detail below.

## 2. user stories

1. As a visiting user I want to be able to add players to a player list.
2. As a visiting user I want the application to create two teams using all players on the list. As we are playing for fun all players will play each match even if the numbers are uneven. No player is asked to sit out a match.
3. As a visiting user I want to be able to add match results and have the application use this information to try to create more evenly balanced teams when I next hit the create teams button.
4. As a visiting user I also need to be able to remove a player from the list if they leave early while the remainder of the group play on.

## 3. Features
## 4. future features

There are a number of features that could be added in time. These generally relate to the method of ranking players through awarding points with a view to refining the process based on additional input and analysis.

1. In addition to providing match results the user could also be provided with the additional optional ability to identify the scorers in a game and how much they scored. Player points could be awarded accordingly. This could allow scoring players on a losing team to gain points.

2. The system could award additional points to players on a winning team if they hold the oposition scoreless. This would award defensive effort.

3. The system could also track the number of wins, draws and loses for each player and add or subtract points accordingly.

In deciding to provide the product initially without any of these features the key consideration is the user the application is aimed at. The product is aimed at the recreational player and the users use of such an application would be for fun. They do not want or expect a detailed analysis.
