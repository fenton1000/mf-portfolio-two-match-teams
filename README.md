# Portfolio Project 2 - Match Teams README
## 1. Purpose of the project

Match Teams is designed for groups playing non-competitive team sports for fun. It allows the user to enter participants' names and the application will then create two teams from the player list. Match results can be entered and this updates player points and the player rankings. Subsequent team selections are based on the latest player rankings with the aim of picking more evenly matched teams. As this is intended as a fun application, player points and rankings run in the background and remain hidden from the user.

Player points awarded are based purely on the score difference in a given match with all players on the winning side awarded the same points. This was considered the best approach in pursuit of a Minimum Viable Product and further refinement could be considered in the future. This is discussed in more detail below.
